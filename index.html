               <h3>Channa Masala</h3>
               <p>
                  A northern Indian vegetarian favorite, chana masala — also called chole — is a chickpea stew made with tomatoes and ample spices that are warming, savory, and soothing at the same time.
                  Many well-stocked Indian grocery stores offer a variety of pre-mixed chana masala spice blends that you can buy — or you can toast your own and keep your favorite spice blend handy if you make this dish often.

               <h3>Fried Zucchini</h3>
               <p>
                  Musaengchae or Fried Zucchini is a Korean side dish. It is surprisingly very flavorful, contrary to how it looks.
                  It's made with julienned radish seasoned with sugar, salt, and vinegar. It has a lovely crunch and a nice balance between sweet and sour.

               <h3>Thai Red Curry with Kabocha Squash</h3>
               <p>
                  Thai Red Curry with Kabocha Squash is a yummy Thailand vegetarian dish. Using prepared red curry paste is an easy and fast way to add traditional Thai flavors to this vegetarian one-pot meal. 
                  It is made by sautéing onion, bell pepper, garlic, and ginger with red curry paste. Coconut milk is added to create the base for the stew. Chunks of kabocha squash simmer in the base for about 20 to 25 minutes, enough time for the curry to thicken, creating a creamy and slightly sweet dish. 
                  Spoon it over steamed white rice or brown rice and pack up any leftovers for a hearty lunch.

               <h3>Steamed Vegetable Dumplings (Zhēngjiǎo)</h3>
               <p>
                  Whereas boiled dumplings have crinkly skins that are tender from having been immersed in hot water, and panfried dumplings have skins that are a combination of crisp bottom and chewy top, steamed dumplings are texturally in between—the skins are slightly chewy and soft. Gentle steam heat also protects the filling flavor and you taste it more, a bonus for delicate combinations such as this one.
                  Unlike many other Chinese dumpling fillings, this vegetarian filling is cooked first to allow the cornstarch to work its cohesive magic, binding the vegetables and pressed tofu together so that they are easier to control when you are assembling the dumplings. I like to use some of the liquid from soaking the mushrooms to season the filling with an earthy savor; if you do too, remember to strain the heady liquid through cheesecloth or paper towel to remove any bits of grit.
